# ptolemy 1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Renamed the package from "nPacMaps" to "ptolemy"
* The `extract_gshhg()` function takes an `sf` object as data and this 
defines the region of interest for extracting from the GSHHG dataset
* Improved functionality and reliability when the region of interest crosses 180
